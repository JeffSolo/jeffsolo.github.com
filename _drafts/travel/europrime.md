# Introduction

My sister and I planned our first trip to Europe, which double as our first trip outside of the US/Canada.
We long thought that we would make good travel buddies - her being of an extraverted, gregarious disposition, ensuring we would have fun, and me with a more logistical-oriented mindset that would make sure we had a place to sleep. Plus she happens to be one of my favorite people in the world. 
The actual purpose of this trip was two-fold. First, obviously, to travel through parts of Europe. Second, my sister would be spending the next semester studying abroad in Dublin. The trip would end with her moving into her new campus residence, and me returning to the States alone. 

Bags packed, we drove out from the Boise area on Sunday August 20, 2017 to Kirkland, Washington. In Kirkland we met up with the parents of my sister's friend, who graciously provided beds for us before our early Monday flight, as well as free parking.
Early Monday we hopped in an Uber and made our way to the airport. The most notable, or at the very least memorable, part of the outward journey turned out to be the five hour layover in Toronto - if only due to the fact that they had an unlimited refill soda fountain, which I made ample use of. 
Seven hours later (which means tomorrow, thanks to the time change) we landed in Dublin, recieving our first-ever passport stamps, on Tuesday, August 22. We then began the very exciting task of finding a place to store my sister's excess school luggage for a few days. Pro tip: most airports have baggage storage (who'da thunk?). Without leaving the airport, we turned around and hopped on a plane to London.

# London
The first thing you should know about flying to London is that it has a lot of airports. Six International ones to be exact. 
The second thing you should know about flying to London is that most of the airports are not actually *IN* London. Particularly if you're flying on a budget airline, be prepared to spend an hour or two getting to the places you're most likely interested in (which at this point is probably your Airbnb). 
After a quite forgettable journey to our Airbnb, which in all likelihood consisted of a mixture of one or buses and the "tube", and through the guide of some instructions recieved via *WhatsApp*, we managed to find the place and drop off our luggage. With no plan in mind, we hopped on a bus (or possibly walked) heading in general direction of the major attractions you want to see in London. 

I recall being slightly wary of *WhatsApp*, having never heard of it, much less used it in the United States. 
For those who don't know, its a messaging app that uses the internet to send messages - most<sup>citation needed</sup> Europeans use it in lieu of the default messenger on their app. I assume this is because many cellular providers don't include cheap unlimited SMS messaging in their plans. 
(This is, of course, all pure conjecture so don't trust anything I say. Ever. No more warnings.)
Facebook later bought WhatsApp, and now uses it to spy on you.... but I digress. 

## Accommodation
If you've ever gone a trip before, you've already had to deal with this. Its super easy: you have a few basic options: hotel/motel, [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com), hostels, airbnbs, planes/trains/automobiles, or the great (ocasionally less-than-great) outdoors. 
Google is your friend (but only in this instance, you're just an object to them.)
For the majority of this trip, we went with the Airbnb option. 
The great part about an Airbnb with two people is that you get to split the cost in half. 
The less exciting part when you're traveling with a sibling, is that these rooms are usually set up to be more accommodating for couples. 
If you go this route, I recommend traveling with a partner who is less of a bed hog than my sister. 


## To See or Not To See

### Museums
***"My favorite discovery in London, being the cheap-ass that I am, was finding out that all their museums are free."***
To my recollection, we only visited two London museums, but there are many, many more.

#### Imperial War Museum
Purely by accident, the first big thing in London we did consisted of visiting the Imperial War Museum. 
We happened to see an interesting looking building and, not knowing what it was, decided to go in.

Fortunately, I had not yet come to the realization that museums, in general, are just something I feel obligated to go to so I can pretend that I'm smart and cultured.
For those who aren't typically fans of museums, I still recommend this particular one. It is hands down the best I have ever seen. 
The displays are very well done, and particularly the World War I and II exhibits feel more like you're in a story than a museum. 
One thing you'll likely notice during your time in London is how heavily England was involved in WWI (and II, for that matter). 
Coming from the States, I think it's easy to gloss over WWI, and most of WWII as well,
right up until the point where the good ol' U.S. of A. selflessly joins at the last minute to save the day, 
as I've tried countless times to explain to my european friends.
(Also, let it be noted that my German friends in particular are not very adept at detecting sarcasm, which can get you into trouble.)

#### Science Museum
My unaided memories of this place include seeing a differential equation solver machine, old nautical navigation equipment, old computer stuff, and something that does something with atoms.
If you're into science *AND* museums, this is the place for you. 

#### Churchhill War Rooms
The only thing I can say is, if you are interested in visiting, book the tickets **NOW**. 

Oh, and it isn't free. 

### Buckingham Palace
Do you want to see the Queen? Too bad, so does everyone else, and you can't. 
But you can see where she lives and that's almost the same. 

If you're really lucky you might get to wade through a crowd of people to see one of her guests being driven away with an escort. 
Come to think of it I don't remember an escort... perhaps it was a maintenance person. Oh well, we saw someone leave the palace at least. 
Rather, we could see a crowd watching someone leave the palace. We most very certainly saw the backsides of a large number of people. 
The outside of the Palace is nice, but I would not call it a "must-see". 
I believe if you wait in a queue and give someone money, you can probably go inside parts of it. It's probaby pretty. We did not.

### Markets


#### Borough Market

#### Camden Market


### London Tower
We somehow missed this our first time in London. 
I don't know if it was closed for renovation or what, but *you* should definitely go in.

### Big Ben
It's hard to miss if you're in London. Especially now that it's a huge construction zone. 
Fortunately we went a week or two before reconstruction maintenence started, so we got to see him in his full glory.

### Parliament Building

### Westminster Abbey

### Saint Paul's Cathedral
We didn't go inside this trip, as far as I can recall. I don't remember walking around the outside of it either, but we probably did.
Either way, you should pay the ten or so pounds to go inside - they don't take it directly out of your flesh.

### Bridges

### London Bridge
Look out over the River Thames (pronounced Temz, silly British).  
You see that really cool bridge? The one with the cool turrets on it?
Yeah, the one that looks castle-y? Pretty neat, right?
Ok, now look left (or right, if you're on the North bank).
You see that boring-ass river crossing over there? That's London Bridge.

### Tower Bridge
Ok, now look ahead. That majestic, badass, turreted draw-bridge is Tower Bridge.
I don't understand the fuss about London Bridge falling down, good riddance.

### Westminster Bridge
Alright, now walk to that bend in the Thames. No, the other bend, the one towards where all the cool shit is.
Yeah, see that bridge in the distance, the one sandwiched between Big Ben and the London Eye? 
No? Ok, well you see all the scaffolding? That's Big Ben. And the bridge in front of it is Westminster Bridge. 
An easy way to remember that is... see that giant building behind Big Ben? That's Westminster Abbey, named after the Bridge.
Alright, I admit it's a lopsided sandwich, but you get it. Hella views. Oh, also Parliament is there too. 

## Foods

### Fish and Chips
You get peas with it, don't ask me why. And they'll stiff you on tartar sauce. Still delicous.

### Bangers and Mash
With a name like that, how could you not order it?

### Sheperd's Pie
Think "Chicken Pot Pie" (as opposed to "Pumpkin Pie"), but better.
There's a spot in Borough Market we went to multiple times. I don't remember the name, but you'll find it. 

### Pubs
We found a pub called "The White Stag" or "The Stag's Head" or "The Boar" or something... it had a cool name, and was
a fine pub. You probably can't go wrong with most pubs here (unless you're looking for cheap. You came to the wrong city.)
