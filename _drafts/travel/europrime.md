# Introduction

My sister and I planned our first trip to Europe, which double as our first trip outside of the US/Canada.
We long thought that we would make good travel buddies - her being of an extraverted, gregarious disposition, ensuring we would have fun, and me with a more logistical-oriented mindset that would make sure we had a place to sleep. Plus she happens to be one of my favorite people in the world.
The actual purpose of this trip was two-fold. First, obviously, to travel through parts of Europe. Second, my sister would be spending the next semester studying abroad in Dublin. The trip would end with her moving into her new campus residence, and me returning to the States alone.

Bags packed, we drove out from the Boise area on Sunday August 20, 2017 to Kirkland, Washington. In Kirkland we met up with the parents of my sister's friend, who graciously provided beds for us before our early Monday flight, as well as free parking.
Early Monday we hopped in an Uber and made our way to the airport. The most notable, or at the very least memorable, part of the outward journey turned out to be the five hour layover in Toronto - if only due to the fact that they had an unlimited refill soda fountain, which I made ample use of.
Seven hours later (which means tomorrow, thanks to the time change) we landed in Dublin, receiving our first-ever passport stamps, on Tuesday, August 22. We then began the very exciting task of finding a place to store my sister's excess school luggage for a few days. Pro tip: most airports have baggage storage (who'da thunk?). Without leaving the airport, we turned around and hopped on a plane to London.

# London
The first thing you should know about flying to London is that it has a lot of airports. Six International ones to be exact.
The second thing you should know about flying to London is that most of the airports are not actually *IN* London. Particularly if you're flying on a budget airline, be prepared to spend an hour or two getting to the places you're most likely interested in (which at this point is probably your Airbnb).
After a quite forgettable journey to our Airbnb, which in all likelihood consisted of a mixture of one or buses and the "tube", and through the guide of some instructions received via *WhatsApp*, we managed to find the place and drop off our luggage. With no plan in mind, we hopped on a bus (or possibly walked) heading in general direction of the major attractions you want to see in London.

I recall being slightly wary of *WhatsApp*, having never heard of it, much less used it in the United States.
For those who don't know, its a messaging app that uses the internet to send messages - most<sup>[citation needed]</sup> Europeans use it in lieu of the default messenger on their app. I assume this is because many cellular providers don't include cheap unlimited SMS messaging in their plans.
(This is, of course, all pure conjecture so don't trust anything I say. Ever. No more warnings.)
Facebook later bought WhatsApp, and now uses it to spy on you.... but I digress.

## Getting around London


## To See or Not To See

### Museums
***"My favorite discovery in London, being the cheap-ass that I am, was finding out that all their museums are free."***
To my recollection, we only visited two London museums, but there are many, many more.

#### Imperial War Museum
Purely by accident, the first big thing in London we did consisted of visiting the Imperial War Museum.
We happened to see an interesting looking building and, not knowing what it was, decided to go in.

Fortunately, I had not yet come to the realization that museums, in general, are just something I feel obligated to go to so I can pretend that I'm smart and cultured.
For those who aren't typically fans of museums, I still recommend this particular one. It is hands down the best I have ever seen.
The displays are very well done, and particularly the World War I and II exhibits feel more like you're in a story than a museum.
One thing you'll likely notice during your time in London is how heavily England was involved in WWI (and II, for that matter).
Coming from the States, I think it's easy to gloss over WWI, and most of WWII as well,
right up until the point where the good ol' U.S. of A. selflessly joins at the last minute to save the day,
as I've tried countless times to explain to my European friends.
(Also, let it be noted that my German friends in particular are not very adept at detecting sarcasm, which can get you into trouble.)

#### Science Museum
My unaided memories of this place include seeing a differential equation solver machine, old nautical navigation equipment, old computer stuff, and something that does something with atoms.
If you're into science *AND* museums, this is the place for you.

#### Churchhill War Rooms
The only thing I can say is, if you are interested in visiting, book the tickets **NOW**..
Oh, and it isn't free.

### Buckingham Palace
Do you want to see the Queen? Too bad, so does everyone else, and you can't.
But you can see where she lives and that's almost the same, right?

If you're really lucky you might get to wade through a crowd of people to see one of her guests being driven away with an escort.
Come to think of it I don't remember an escort... perhaps it was a maintenance person. Oh well, we saw someone leave the palace at least.
Rather, we could see a crowd watching someone leave the palace. At the very least, we most very certainly saw the backsides of a large number of people.
The outside of the Palace is nice, but I would not call it a "must-see".
I believe if you wait in a queue and give someone money, you can probably go inside parts of it. It's probably pretty. We did not.

### Markets

#### Borough Market
We happened to randomly stumble upon Borough Market (although it's not that hard to do).
This cute little market, located on the south side of London bridge is a great place to grab some lunch.
This is where we had our first ever Shepard's pie. I think the name had someone to do with cow's.
"Moo Pie" or the like. Or maybe it had nothing to do with cows. Anyway, you're bound to find something you like.

#### Camden Market
This is another spot I have no memory of visiting my first time in London. I definitely did my second time, and you
definitely should your first. Maybe I was too busy leading my sister around to look at random unexciting stuff.

### London Tower
We somehow missed this our first time in London. I think we walked around it but didn't go in.
I don't know if it was closed when we wanted to go or if we just ran out of time, but *you* should definitely pay the money to see inside.

### Big Ben
It's hard to miss if you're in London. Especially now that it's a huge construction zone.
Fortunately we went a week or two before maintenance work started, so we got to see him in his full glory.
He's a big clock.

### Parliament Building
You get the best view on the opposite side of the Thames.
It's cooler seeing it in person even than watching it blow up in V for Vendetta.

### Westminster Abbey
Even if Big Ben is hidden by construction, it's worth walking over Westminster Bridge to check out the Abbey.
I haven't been inside, but the outside is quite pretty.

### Saint Paul's Cathedral
We didn't go inside this trip, as far as I can recall. I don't remember walking around the outside of it either,
but we probably did.
Either way, you should pay the ten or so pounds to go inside - they don't take it directly out of your flesh.

## Bridges
There are a lot of bridges crossing the Thames (pronounced Temz, silly British).
Here are a few of the ones I remember.

### London Bridge
Look out over the River Thames...  
You see that really cool bridge? The one with the cool turrets on it?
Yeah, the one that looks castle-like? Pretty awesome, right?
Ok, now look left (or right, if you're on the North bank).
You see that boring-ass river crossing over there? That's London Bridge.

### Tower Bridge
Ok, now look ahead. That majestic, badass, turreted draw-bridge is Tower Bridge.
I must confess I don't understand all the fuss about London Bridge falling down - good riddance.

### Westminster Bridge
Alright, now walk to that bend in the Thames. No, the other bend, the one towards where all the cool shit is.
Yeah, see that bridge in the distance, the one sandwiched between Big Ben and the London Eye.
No? Ok, well you see all the scaffolding? That's Big Ben. And the bridge in front of it is Westminster Bridge.
An easy way to remember that is... see that giant building behind Big Ben? That's Westminster Abbey, named after the Bridge.
Alright, I admit it's a lopsided sandwich, but you get it. Hella views. Oh, also Parliament is there too.

### Millennium Bridge
This is a sweet pedestrian bridge. Give it a go.

### Globe Theater
IF you have time, go see a play inside the Globe Theater.
It's not the original theater, but this 1997 replica does lie roughly 750 feet (230 meters for the laymen and women) from where the original stood. Shows are reasonably priced and, as you can imagine, very well done.
We watched *Much Ado About Nothing* set during the Mexican revolution, which happens to be my favorite Shakespeare piece.

### Monument to the Great Fire of London
I made my sister walk an unreasonable distance on our sore feet to see this glorified column.
I basically dragged her from point-of-interest to point-of-interest (according to Google maps) for much of this trip.
After much more experience, I do not recommend traveling this way. Sorry, sis.

## Foods

### Fish and Chips
You get peas with it, don't ask me why. And they'll stiff you on tartar sauce. Still delicious.

### Bangers and Mash
With a name like that, how could you not order it?

### Sheperd's Pie
Think "Chicken Pot Pie" (as opposed to "Pumpkin Pie"), but better.
There's a spot in Borough Market we went to multiple times. I don't remember the name, but you'll find it.

### Pubs
We found a pub called "The White Stag" or "The Stag's Head" or "The Boar" or something... it had a cool name, and was
a fine pub. You probably can't go wrong with most pubs here (unless you're looking for cheap, you came to the wrong city).

# Leaving
After a full day and a half of sightseeing, an uncomfortable shower with a clogged drain, and a poor night's sleep sharing a less-than-queen bed with my sister, it was time to start my hat collection.
I decided to buy a baseball cap for every city we visited that trip, so the morning of our flight, we found a souvenir stand and I bought an overpriced hat with the Union Jack on it.
Whether or not this had to do with the mysterious disappearance of my wallet a few hours later is still up for debate.
I maintain that it must have slipped through the large hole that had developed in my new shorts pocket, recently purchased from wal-mart for the sole purpose of this trip. To be fair, I also bought a pair of pants at the same time which I still have today... although a second pair of those pants did cause me considerable pain during our EuroThanksgiving.
My mother contests that I became an obvious target for pick-pocketers.
Either way, before we'd left our first destination I'd managed to lose all my credit cards, a few pounds in cash, and an Oyster card. I discovered this dilemma when I went to pay for our last London meal, which was more fish and chips. Fortunately my little sister is responsible and managed to keep hold of her wallet, and thus my source of payment, for the rest of the trip.

After an annoyed bus ride (or however we got to the distant London Gatwick Airport), we got on a plane to Amsterdam.
