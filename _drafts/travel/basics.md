## Accommodation
If you've ever gone a trip before, you've already had to deal with this. Its super easy: you have a few basic options: hotel/motel, [couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com), hostels, airbnbs, planes/trains/automobiles, or the great (ocasionally less-than-great) outdoors.
Google is your friend (but only in this instance, you're just an object to them.)
For the majority of this trip, we went with the Airbnb option.
The great part about an Airbnb with two people is that you get to split the cost in half.
The less exciting part when you're traveling with a sibling, is that these rooms are usually set up to be more accommodating for couples.
If you go this route, I recommend traveling with a partner who is less of a bed hog than my sister.

## Airlines
Cheap airlines only bring 1 bag

## Trains 
Most places have a train pass

## What to pack



I made my sister walk an unreasonable distance on our sore feet to see this glorified column.
I basically dragged her from point-of-interest to point-of-interest (according to Google maps) for much of this trip.
After much more experience, I do not recommend traveling this way. Sorry, sis.
