		Hi, I'm Jeff. I go by Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeffy, or whatever other variations one may conjur.
		<br><br>
		I am currently a student at the University of  Idaho, working on two B.S. in both computational mathematics and psychology.
		I also have minors in computer science and statistics and am expecting to gradate May 2015. 
		<br><br>		
		I currently work as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Idaho's Cognition and Usability Lab, under <a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/class/psychcomm/steffenwerner">Dr. Steffen Werner</a>. 
		<br><br>
		In my freetime I enjoy <a href="http://jeffreysolo.com/2015/03/30/books/">reading</a>, PC gaming, and a variety of outdoor activities. <br>
		My favorite computer games include Portal and the Half-Life series, and I thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle game.
		<br><br>
		I play soccer and have recently taken up rock climbing, which is a new passion of mine.
		<br><br>
		As you may have noticed, I have a rather eclectic group of interests, but I have always favored math, technology and science, and hope to make a career out of it.
		I am currently looking into the Data Science fields, but am also considering going to graduate school for Neuroscience or some related degree.
		<br><br>
		If you would like to know more about me, or just feel like chatting, send me an email - <a href="mailto:jeff@jeffreysolo.com">jeff@jeffreysolo.com</a>
		<br><br>
		Thanks for reading!
		<br>Jeff Solomon
