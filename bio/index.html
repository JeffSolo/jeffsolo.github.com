		Hi, I'm Jeff. I go by Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeffy, or whatever other variations one may conjur.
		<br><br>
		I graduated in May 2015 from the University of  Idaho with degrees in mathematics and psychology as well as minors in computer science and statistics. 
		<br><br>		
		I currently work as a Rate Analyst Intern at <a href="http://vacasa.com"/>Vacasa</a>.
		<br><br>
		In my freetime I enjoy <a href="http://jeffreysolo.com/2015/03/30/books/">reading</a>, PC gaming, and a variety of outdoor activities (especially rock climbing). 		My favorite computer games include Portal and the Half-Life series, and I thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle game.
		<br><br><br>
		As you may have noticed, I have a rather eclectic group of interests, but I have always favored math, technology and science, and hope to make a career out of it.
		<br><br>
		If you would like to know more about me, or just feel like chatting, send me an email - <a href="mailto:jeff@jeffreysolo.com">jeff@jeffreysolo.com</a>
		<br><br>
		Thanks for reading!
		<br>Jeff Solomon
