    Hi, I'm Jeff. I go by Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeffy, or whatever other variations one may conjur.
    <br><br>
    I graduated in May 2015 from the University of Idaho with degrees in mathematics and psychology as well as minors in computer science and statistics.
    <br><br>
    I am currently living in Kleve, Germany, where I am taking classes in Bioengineering.
    <br><br>
    Previously, I worked as an Associate Data Scientist at <a href="http://vacasa.com"/>Vacasa</a>.
    <br><br>
    In my freetime I enjoy <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-03-30-books %}">reading</a>, PC gaming, and a variety of outdoor activities (especially rock climbing).     My favorite computer games include Portal and the Half-Life series, and I thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle game.
    <br><br>
    If you would like to know more about me, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:jeff@jeffreysolo.com">jeff@jeffreysolo.com</a>
    <br><br>
    Best,
    <br>Jeff Solomon
