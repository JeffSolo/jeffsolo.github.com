Hi, I'm Jeff. I go by Jeff, Jeffrey, Jeffy, or whatever other variations one may conjur.
<br><br>
I graduated in May 2015 from the University of Idaho with degrees in mathematics and psychology as well as minors in computer science and statistics.
<br><br>
I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Bioinformatics at the Universität des Saarlandes in Saarbrücken, Germany.
<br><br>
Previously, I worked as an Associate Data Scientist at <a href="https://vacasa.com"/>Vacasa</a>.
<br><br>
In my freetime I enjoy <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-03-30-books %}">reading</a>, PC gaming, and a variety of outdoor activities (especially rock climbing).
My favorite computer games include Portal and the Half-Life series, and I thoroughly enjoy a good puzzle game.
<br><br>
Best,
<br>Jeff Solomon
