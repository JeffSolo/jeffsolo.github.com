  <h3>Unsolicited tongue-in-cheek travel advice from a small-town Idahoan living in Germany</h3>
  <p>During the compilation of this "guide", I realized that I have indeed done a fair bit of traveling.
  This in no way makes me a qualified source, and many of these trips happened months (and years) before I penned them down.
  Thus I am relying on my horrific memory.
  <br>
  Although it may sometimes (perhaps often) appear that I am complaining about my travels, I have yet to take a trip that I did not thorougly enjoy.
  I have on occasion run into some unfortunate, and even painful, circumstances during my times abroad, but I have never regretted any of them.
  <br>
  Really the best advice travel advice I can give you is this: If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong.
