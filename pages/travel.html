  <h3>Unsolicited tongue-in-cheek travel advice from a small-town Idahoan living in small-town Germany</h3>
  <p>It will sometimes (perhaps often) appear that I am complaining about my travels.
  Although I have on occasion run into some unfortunate, and even painful, circumstances during my times abroad,
  I have yet to take a trip that I did not thorougly enjoy. I have never regretted any of them.
