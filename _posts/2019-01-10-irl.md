###### "Fixing social media"..... or something with more eloquence and less self-righteous pretentiousness.

Chances are you're reading this because you saw that thing I posted on [insert social media place here], and wanted to know more.
Or perhaps you were surprised that Jeff has started a blog, and were vaguely interested.
Or even more likely, you're one of Jeff's parents and wanted to support him by reading his work you just discovered (love you guys!).

Whatever your reasons, don't fear, I am not going to get in the habit of self-plugging my blog on social media.
For all I know, I won't bother publishing more posts after this. I don't even really like bloggers (no offense).
In truth, I just didn't want to explain all this on whatever social media platform I posted the link on.

Anyway, here's the deal. We all know that social media makes people feel bad. "Everyone is always having more fun with more friends than me.
Here I am living my boring life while everyone else is doing all these glamorous things..." etc.
We all technically know that it's not, well, probably not, I mean it seems fairly unlikely that people are always having more fun....but then again, I'm sure not partying all the time so.....
And that's the problem. We start to believe things we claim to know aren't true, i.e. everyone else is always having more fun than I.

Long story short, people need to realize that not every day is a party, and most of life is, well, real life, with seemingly mundane day to day activities.
So it is now my intention to utilize my social media accounts to post more "boring", "lame", "everyday" content to
make some people laugh and help us all realize that most days are most days, and not only is that ok, but that's good.
I'd encourage you to do the same. (My sister is going to kill me, she worked so hard on me not sucking at my social
media self portrayal. Sorry sis.).

One last thing, don't interpret this as me telling everyone not to post the highlights. Those are good important things too, just disproportionate.
Also, shout-out to my brothers for getting me to think a little more about this during our recent family trip.

Ah crap, I sure hope most of my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23todayirl&src=typd">#todayirl</a>
things aren't all this bad..."</i>

Much love,
