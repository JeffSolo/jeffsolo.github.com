Here's a (mostly complete) list of books I've read since around the third grade on.
<br>
I am definitely missing lots of the earlier ones I've read, but I have nearly all from around freshman year of high school (2007) on.

* Rating's definitely have bias - I never give a book I finish a 1. 
<br>
Rating preceded by '~' is my approximate guess for what I think I would rate it if I read it again today.
<br>
Rating followed by '!' is what I believe my rating at the time was. 
<br>
Rating '-' means I either can't remember or didn't read enough to rate.
