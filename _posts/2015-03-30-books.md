Here's a (mostly complete) list of books I've read in my life, starting around 3rd grade. I am definitely missing lots of the earlier ones, but I have included nearly all from around freshman year of high school (2007) and beyond.

Alternatively, you can view my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/jeffsolo"> goodreads</a> account  

My rating system can be interpreted as follows...  
  0. Would read again (if I was in the habit of rereading books, which I am not)
  0. Probably wouldn't reread
  0. Wish I had read something else instead
  0. Did not enjoy
  0. Did not finish/Had to read it

* Series finished before I started keeping track are lumped together (Lord of the Rings, Wheel of Time, etc)  
* Rating preceded by **~** is my approximate guess for what I think I would rate it if I read it again today.  
* Rating followed by **!** is what I believe my rating would have been at the time I read it.  

All columns are sortable by clicking on the appropriate header, thanks to <a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">sorttable</a>.
