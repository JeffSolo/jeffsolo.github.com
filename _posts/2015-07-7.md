Here's a (mostly complete) list of PC games I've played and beaten.
<br>
I am probably missing some, but this is the majority of them, with approximate dates finished.

* Rating's definitely have bias - I never give a game I finish a 1. 
<br>
Rating preceded by '~' is my approximate guess for what I think I would rate it if I played it again today.
<br>
Rating followed by '!' is what I believe my rating would have been at the time I played it. 
<br>
Rating '-' means I either can't remember or didn't play enough to rate.
