Here's a (mostly complete) list of books I've read in my life, starting around 3rd grade.
I am definitely missing lots of the earlier ones, but I have included nearly all from around freshman year of high school (2007) and beyond.
Alternatively, you can view my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/jeffsolo">goodreads</a> account.  

Occasionally I'll write a brief <a href="{{ rev_page.url }}">review</a> for books I've read.

My rating system can be interpreted as follows...  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **5**. Would read again (if I was in the habit of rereading books)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **4**. Probably would not reread  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **3**. Wish I had read something else instead  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **2**. Did not enjoy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **1**. Unwillingly finished  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **U**. Unfinished  

* Audiobooks are indicated by ðŸŽ§  
* Ratings followed by **!** are my approximate feelings at the time I read it.
