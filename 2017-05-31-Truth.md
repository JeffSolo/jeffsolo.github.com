Things I believe about life, the universe, and everything.

Believe:
Things don't happen for a reason
Evolution (stuff before man, old earth, death before men existed)
People are selfish, greedy, and think they know best
There is nothing wrong with homosexuals
We should have equality, as near as we can (everyone deserves a chance)
Being in the military doesn't make you a hero
People don't know where their beliefs come from, and can be easily manipulated
Marriage is a good thing
People should keep their promises, and say what they mean
People often don't know what they really want
The rich should share, or be forced to share, with the poor
Thinking your country is the best is stupid
Loyalty to a brand is stupid
Racism, sexism, agism, and the like are stupid
Love usually means doing something you don't want to do
People generally don't know what love actually is
Doing what is right usually means doing something you don't want to do
People trust their own perceptions and memories

Unsure:
God (christianity: heaven, hell, angels, demons, devil)
Abortions
Death Sentences
What I think about transgenders - is it a mental disorder, if not in all, in some?
